/**
 * This function will take the string received over the serial port and then parse it to see what command it is.
 *
 * This system will parse the command packets as long as they start with a #, end with a $, and have comma-delimited fields.
 * Then, it will use the first field to determine the type of command received. Once it determined the command received,
 * it will search the commandList[] array for the corresponding command. If it finds it, the function given in the array's
 * structure will be called to actually execute the command.
 * Should the packet not have any commas, the command interpreter will ignore the packet.
